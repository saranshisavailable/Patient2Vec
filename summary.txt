Patient2Vec : A Personalized Interpretable Deep Representation of the Longitudinal Electronic Health Record
The availability of large amount of Electronic health data can allow us to develop neural networks that can predict the outcome of hospitalisation or a disease based on the medical history of a patient. Patient2Vec aims at developing a personalized interpretable deep representation of the logitudinal health reecord. Longitudinal data resembles text documents so, deep neural networks can be applied to extract meaningful information from the data. Neural networks mimic neurons and the ability of brain to think and make decisions. Feed forward neural network has a problem of memory, it generates an output after processing the input from a hidden layer. So it does not have the ability to process sequential information which is inherent to human language. This problem is solved by Recurrent Neural Networks, which take a hidden state also as an input at each timestep. Now, two types of RNNs have been discussed in the paper namely GRU (gated recurrent unit) and LSTM(Long short term memory)
